# GeneticAlgorithms

Industrial parameter optimization using genetic algorithms. Designed and implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize propeller parameters, such as thrust and efficiency. The project involves creating custom fitness functions tailored to specific experimental goals. Tools: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib.

This project was developed in collaboration with Sergio Martínez Olivera (https://github.com/sergiio8) as part of the Artificial Intelligence I course in the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
